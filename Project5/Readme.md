# Online Shopping Cart System

## Project Overview

The **Online Shopping Cart System** simulates an e-commerce platform where users can browse a catalog of products, manage their shopping carts, and proceed to checkout. This project demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including polymorphism, interfaces, and composition, while adhering to SOLID principles for clean code design.

## Features

1. **Product Catalog**:
    - **Browse Products**: Displays a list of products with their name, description, price, and stock quantity.
    - **Search and Filter**: Allows users to search for products and filter by category or price range.

2. **Shopping Cart**:
    - **Add/Remove Items**: Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, or remove items.
    - **View Cart**: Displays a summary of items in the cart along with the total price.
    - **Apply Discounts**: Allows users to apply discount codes or promotions to the cart.

3. **Checkout Process**:
    - **Order Summary**: Provides a final summary of the order before purchase.
    - **Payment Processing**: Simulates the payment process with a mock payment gateway.
    - **Order Confirmation**: Confirms the order after successful purchase, showing order details and delivery information.

## Development Process

### 1. Project Planning and Discussions
We held **two meetings** to discuss project goals, system requirements, and the feature set. The first meeting focused on the high-level design and features. The second meeting focused on the technical details, task assignments, and ensuring code follows SOLID principles.



### 2. Task Assignment
We used a **Kanban board** to assign tasks for better project management and tracking. Hereâ€™s the task allocation [Kanban board](https://trello.com/b/WYdMN0XZ/fifth-project)



### 3. UML Diagram
The UML Class Diagram visualized the structure, relationships between classes, and how OOP principles were applied.




### 4. Code Implementation

The project follows **SOLID principles**, ensuring each class has a single responsibility. The main classes are:
- `Product`, `CartItem`, `CartManager`, `CartCalculator`, `OrderManager`, `PaymentProcessor`, and `Discount`.

We use **interfaces** to ensure flexibility and maintainability.



### 5. How to Use

1. **Run the application**: After compiling, execute the `Main` class to start the application.
2. **Menu Options**:
    - **1. List of Products**: Browse available products.
    - **2. Add Item**: Add items to the shopping cart.
    - **3. Remove Item**: Remove items from the cart.
    - **4. View Cart**: View a summary of the cart and total cost.
    - **5. Apply Discounts**: Apply discount codes to the cart.
    - **6. Order Summary**: View the final order summary and proceed with the payment.
    - **7. Exit**: Exit the application.
