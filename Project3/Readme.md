# Multiplication Learning Game

## Introduction
The **Multiplication Learning Game** is a console-based educational application designed to help users enhance their multiplication skills. The game presents users with multiplication questions and tracks their performance across varying difficulty levels. The difficulty level adjusts based on the user's performance, providing a personalized learning experience with real-time feedback.

## System Overview
The game offers the following functionalities:
- **Start Game**: Initiates a new game session where users answer multiplication questions.
- **Help**: Provides instructions and rules for playing the game.
- **Show High Score**: Displays the highest score achieved.
- **Exit**: Closes the game application.

## Features and Functionality

### Start Game
**Purpose**: Begin a new game session where the user answers multiplication questions.

**Process**:
1. **Name Entry**: The user is prompted to enter their name.
2. **Question Generation**: The game generates multiplication questions based on the current difficulty level.
3. **Answer Checking**: The user’s responses are checked for correctness.
4. **Scoring**: Correct and incorrect answers are tracked.
5. **Difficulty Adjustment**: The difficulty level increases after three consecutive correct answers. If the user answers three questions incorrectly in a row, the game ends.
6. **Feedback**: The user receives feedback on their performance. The game concludes after 20 questions or upon "Game Over."

### Help
**Purpose**: Provide instructions and guidance on how to play the game.

**Process**:
1. **Game Description**: The game explains that it is a multiplication learning tool.
2. **Gameplay Instructions**: Users are informed about how to answer multiplication questions and the rules for advancing difficulty levels.

### Show High Score
**Purpose**: Display the highest score achieved in the game.

**Process**:
1. **High Score Display**: The game shows the current high score based on the best performance recorded.

### Exit
**Purpose**: Close the game application.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Flowchart Creation
We started by creating a detailed flowchart to map out the game’s structure and logic, ensuring a clear understanding of the game’s functionality before diving into coding.

### 2. Task Assignment via Kanban Table
A Kanban table was created to distribute tasks among team members effectively. Each task was assigned based on individual strengths and workload, ensuring smooth progress and collaboration.(Kanban)[https://trello.com/b/5g5WLibO/third-project]

### 3. Development
We then proceeded to code the game, following the flowchart and task assignments. Regular code reviews and discussions were held to maintain code quality and alignment with the project goals.

### 4. Manual Testing
Once the game was fully implemented, we conducted thorough manual testing to validate and verify the functionality. This ensured that the game worked as expected and that any bugs were identified and resolved before final delivery.
